# CoreDataExample
This is a sample app that demonstrates using Core Data in a framework.  

## Motivation
I had a need for multiple apps to share the same underlying data model.  This project solves the problem by building a Core Data 
stack that compiles into a framework.  The .xcdatamodel schema file is compiled into a bundle.


Most of the work is actually inside of the [Actual Data Model.](https://github.com/ctinnell/CoreDataModel "Actual Data Model")
